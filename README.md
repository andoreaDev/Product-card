## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

My major learnings while working through this project were the use of position and grid. 


### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on media queries, grid and flexbox in future projects.


### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/espanol/news/como-centrar-cualquier-cosa-en-css-usando-flexbox-y-grid/) - This helped me understand about flexbox and grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me make my page responsive.
